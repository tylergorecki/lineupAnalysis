# MLB Lineup Analysis

Using all pitches from the 2022 MLB season, we built an expected runs function that we used to analyze many possible lineup configurations in Major League Baseball. This expected runs function simulates possible out comes pitch by pitch using sampling techniques in R. The probabilities the sampling occurs from is gathered from the 2022 MLB pitch-by-pitch data. We tested all permutations of the most common lineups we found in the MLB that season, with hitters grouped into three categories, contact, middle, and power, based on contact percentage.
